      My academic journey began at the Polytechnic of Turin, where I earned a
      Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering. Along these three years, I had
      the opportunity to participate to the Cyberchallenge Project, which
      introduced me to the world of Cybersecurity. I fell in love with binary
      challenges and explored the inner details of the memory and its
      associated vulnerabilities. This experience inspired me to pursue a
      Master's Degree with a specialization in Cybersecurity.

      In the first year of my Master's program, I took a course on System and
      Devices Programming, which deepened my interest in Operating Systems and
      solidified my desire to become an expert in this field. I was then
      awarded an Erasmus Scholarship, allowing me to pursue a Double Degree at
      Eurecom, located in the heart of Sophia Antipolis (France), also known as
      Europe's Silicon Valley.

      After studying for one year in Turin and another year at Sophia
      Antipolis, I completed the Double Degree program with a six months
      internship at Amadeus S.A.S. The company is one of the top global
      software providers and a major Global Distribution System (GDS) for the
      travel and tourism industries. During my internship, I worked on
      integrating a Fuzzer into their C++ core software stack.

      In April 2024, I graduated magna cum laude from the Polytechnic of Turin.

      Since then, I have been dedicating time to a mentorship program on the
      Linux kernel (as a mentee) and am actively seeking job opportunities.
